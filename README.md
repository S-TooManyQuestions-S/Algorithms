# **Algorithm Library**
> My own implementations of the algorithms with additional comments (RUS)
***
Each algorithm implemetation contains following folders and files:
* docs - task description
* test - tests with input and correct output
* main file
* description for build (optional)
* credits (optional)

Following algorithms and data structures are implemented:
* Roaring Bitmap (Invisible Join Method) - C#
* Cuckoo-Filter - C++
* R-Tree (using Gdal Library) - C++
* B-Tree (complete implemetation) - C++
* Graham algorithm - C#, C++
* Manacher algorithm - C#
